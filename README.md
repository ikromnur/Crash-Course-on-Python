- About this Course
  
This course is designed to teach you the foundations in order to write simple programs in Python using the most common structures. No previous exposure to programming is needed. By the end of this course, you will understand the benefits of programming in IT roles; understand basic Python syntax; explore different code editors and developer environments; be able to write simple programs using Python; figure out how the building blocks of programming fit together; and combine all of this knowledge to solve a complex programming problem.

 We'll start off by diving into the basics of writing a computer program. Along the way, you’ll get hands-on experience with programming concepts through interactive exercises and real-world examples. You’ll quickly start to see how computers can perform a multitude of tasks — you just have to write code that tells them what to do.

Module 1


Hello Python!
In this module we’ll introduce you to the Coursera platform and the course format. Then, we’ll dive into the basics of programming languages and syntax, as well as automation using scripting. We’ll also introduce you to the Python programming language and cover some basic functions and keywords of the language, along with some arithmetic operations. Lastly, we'll go over some code editors and IDEs that you can use to write Python code.

Graded: Module 1 Graded Assessment

- How It Works

General

1. How do I pass?

  - To earn your Certificate, you’ll need to earn a passing
    grade on each of the required assignments—these can be quizzes,
    peer-graded assignments, or programming assignments. Videos, readings,
    and practice exercises are there to help you prepare for the graded
    assignments. 

2. What do start dates and end dates mean?

 - Once you enroll,
    you’ll have access to all videos, readings, quizzes, and programming
    assignments (if applicable). If you choose to
    explore the content without purchasing, you may not be able to access
    certain assignments.  If you don’t finish all graded assignments before
    the end of the session, you can reset your deadlines. Your
    progress will be saved and you’ll be able to pick up where you left off.

3. What are due dates? Is there a penalty for submitting my
      work after a due date?

 - Within a course, there are suggested due dates to help you
    manage your schedule and keep work from piling up. Quizzes and
    programming assignments can be submitted late without consequence.
    However, it is possible that you won't receive a grade if you submit
    your peer-graded assignment too late because classmates usually review
    assignment within three days of the assignment deadline.

4. Can I re-attempt an assignment?

      Yes. If you want to improve your grade, you can always try again.
        If you’re re-attempting a peer-graded assignment, re-submit your work
        as soon as you can to make sure there’s enough time for your classmates
        to review your work. In some cases you may need to wait before
        re-submitting a programming assignment or quiz. We encourage you to
        review learning material during this delay.
